Recommendation: 

This program takes the **current** path then saves the folder as the same 
hierarchy at remote. So it's recommended to use it while inside the folder 
which is desired to be synced. Plus, saves a log file in the current folder.

Example:

  \e[36mcd /path/to/the/folder && rclone-sync âŽ†\e[0m

"


if [[ $1 == '--no-prompt' ]]; then
  echo "Syncing $folder_to_sync ..."
else
  # Prompt user if agrees the current folder is to be synced
  echo -e "Then, syncing \e[33m$folder_to_sync\e[0m... [y/N]? "; read answer
  case $answer in
    [Yy]|[Yy][Ee][Ss])
      echo "Syncing $folder_to_sync ..."
      ;;
    [Nn]|[Nn][Oo])
      echo "Canceled, exiting."
      exit 1
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Not answered properly, exiting..."
      exit 0

# Define a secret file needed to be encoded
